Collaborative project which allows users to design their own platofrmer and play it all in the same application! Created for Computer Science 308 at Duke University (Go Blue Devils!). Winner of the award for Best Feature for the ability to rewind your game in real time while you play it!

Check out the Wiki for more information on how to use our Application.

This project emphasized intelligent design and self documenting code while working with a version control system in a large team environment. Programmers started from scratch using what they had learned in the class to design their own API, improve the user experience, and ultimately have a functioning Application which allowed a user to create her own platformer only limited by imagination (and what features had been added). Options for the user included different camera options, death scenarios, gravity and terrain interactions, a variety of enemy behaviors, and the flexibility to make thousands of games if the user was willing to put in the requisite creativity, which were then all immediately playable in a streamlined playing environment.
