# Platformer Maker (a.k.a Raindrop Salad)

## Description
We created a game authoring environment and a game engine that allows users to create and play their very own games. The back-end and front-end for both the authoring environment and the game engine were created using Java. Information from the game authoring environment is saved using XML and sent to the back-end for the game engine to render and execute. The project makes use of the MVC & Entity-Component paradigms.

This collaborative project was completed as our Computer Science 308: Software Design & Implementation final project. It was rewarded the Best Feature award for the ability to rewind the game in real time.

Check out the Wiki for more information on how to use our application.

This project emphasized intelligent design and self documenting code while working with a version control system in a large team environment. Programmers started from scratch using what they had learned in the class to design their own API, improve the user experience, and ultimately have a functioning Application which allowed a user to create her own platformer only limited by imagination (and what features had been added). Options for the user included different camera options, death scenarios, gravity and terrain interactions, a variety of enemy behaviors, and the flexibility to make thousands of games if the user was willing to put in the requisite creativity, which were then all immediately playable in a streamlined playing environment.
